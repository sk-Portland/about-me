        Let's Explore Neurogenesis in Adults

    </h1></header>

    <h3>What is neurogenesis?</h3>
    <P></P>Neurogenesis is the division of new brain cells. In this case, we are specifically refering to the brain. </P>

    <h3>Animal studies</h3>
    <p>Some of the more interesting findings is that adult animals often have new brain cells (and an increase in size) of parts of the brain during seasons associated with a behavior. For example, birds that sing to attract mates have new brain cells in the hippocampus during this time period. 

    </p>Studies in primates and rats suggest that stress is associated with a <bold>decrease</bold> in neurogenesis, or fewer new brain cells are born during high stress. 

    <h3>But what about humans?</h3>
    <p>Studies have found that even elderly humans (in their 70s and 80s) have new new brain cells in a part of the brain devoted to the formation of new memory, the hippocampus. </p>

    <h3>Let's look closer at the science</h3>
    <p>Parts of the brain that have been found to have neurogenesis in adulthood:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Olfactory bulb</li>
            <li>Hippocampus</li>
            <li>Cells lining the cerebral ventricles</li>
         <ul>

    <p>Methodology to demonstrate neurogenesis (in addition to compliance with good clinical practice, such as obtaining signed consent and permissions with human subjects): </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Injecting people with a thymdine analog (bromodeoxyuradine or BrdU to label dividing cells. </li>
            <li>Upon death of the person, taking the brain, preserving it, and using antibidies tagged to a marker to label cells with BrdU.</li>
            <li>Use another marker to label neurons</li>
            <li>Using a miscroscope to image sections of the brain to find whether there are cells with both BrdU and neuronal markers.</li>


        </ol>
